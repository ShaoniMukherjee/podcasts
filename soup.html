<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert (Bob) Gatenby is a radiologist who specializes in exploring theoretical and experimental models of evolutionary dynamics in cancer and cancer drug resistance. He has developed an adaptive therapy approach for treating cancer which has shown promise in improving survival times with less cumulative drug use. In this episode, Bob explains what brought him into medicine, his search for organizing principles from which to understand cancer, and the mathematical modeling of other complex systems that led him to model the dynamics of tumor cell changes in cancer. He discusses his pilot clinical trial treating metastatic prostate cancer, in which he used an evolutionary game theory model to analyze patient-specific tumor dynamics and determine the on/off cycling of treatment. He describes how altering chemotherapy to maximize the fitness ratio between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells can increase patient survival and explains how treatment of metastatic cancer may be improved using adaptive therapy and strategic sequencing of different chemotherapy drugs.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob’s unlikely path to medicine and his disappointment with his medical school experience [1:45]</span></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter stumbled across Bob’s work preparing for another podcast</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The article in </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cancer-treatment-darwin-evolution/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wired </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">about his new approach to treating cancer quickly captivated him </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, Bob wanted to be a physicist</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After working with some great physicists, he came to the conclusion that he wasn’t smart enough</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the Vietnam war era and going to medical school was considered something that was really for humanity; he decided to do that</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was at Princeton as an undergrad in the late sixties-early seventies</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter notes </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Feynman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> did his PhD at Princeton too, and undergrad at MIT</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was the shadow of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feynman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there in the late sixties because he had just won his </span><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1965/summary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobel prize in ‘65</span></a>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheeler </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">was still the department chair; he was one of the great physicists of his generation</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob’s TA won a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Field Medal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; it’s only awarded every 4 years</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was surrounded by really smart people</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an intellectually exciting to be there at the time</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Witten"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Witten</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was there; he was very involved in string theory</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into medicine seemed like the right thing to do in that era</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people, including him, had the desire to help people</span></li>

<p><b>Medical school and how doctors think</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that’s another part of your story that I can relate to…I realized very quickly that in biology, you couldn’t think your way out of every problem the way you could in math or physics or engineering.” – Peter Attia</span></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob discovers in his first semester in medical school, in histology that he cannot intuit his way through this class; he has to memorize everything</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This foreshadowed some other issues he had with his medical journey</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It brought him back to his previous 12 years of Catholic school, with catechism; this kind of rote memorization</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He found similarities between clinical medicine and catechism; when asked the scripted question, one is required to make the scripted answer</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">He remembers one scripted question – why do cancers grow</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scripted answer was, because cancer cells grow faster than normal cells</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s totally wrong, on so  many levels that it’s hard to believe</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical school was less scientific than he expected</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost like a trade school in the sense of learning from masters the way to do things</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s very difficult to get physicians as a group, to stop talking dogma and simply think</span></i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Memorizing becomes their way of thinking in medical school</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob finds that for things that have been done the same way for the last 5 decades, questioning it doesn’t go over well with physicians</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is discussed in books such as  </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doctors-Plague-Childbed-Semmelweis-Discoveries/dp/039332625X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+doctor%27s+plague&amp;qid=1632146077&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Doctor’s Plague</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Map-Londons-Terrifying-Epidemic/dp/1594482691/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+ghost+map&amp;qid=1632146178&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ghost Map</span></a>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ignac Semmelweis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a physician in the 1800’s who pioneered handwashing and antiseptic techniques </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid 19th century, the medical community was very, very conservative; and even moving them toward washing hands or using a septic technique took decades</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Semmelweis died in an insane asylum for having been so rejected and cast out by the medical community</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter relates a story from his medical training, during his residency (6-7 years into his training)</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s looking for any excuse to apply mathematics to problem solving</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of his critical care fellows in the ICU rotation (an anesthesiologist) had a PhD in math</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was the first person who could really put all of the critical care equations into their truest form of physiologic differential equations</span></li>
<li aria-level="3" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t just explain the dogma but could really show you the theory</span></li>
<li aria-level="3" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter and he would stay up late, forgo sleep, and talk really deep about medicine</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Months later Peter became dumbfounded at how naively they would dose antibiotics, based on guessing decay times</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought there must be a more accurate way to do this</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were equations that could accurately describe how the plasma concentration of gentamycin would decay; all that was needed was a few more data points</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the course of a couple weeks, he built a model that would predict the exact right time to be checking </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/34/6/730/383556"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nadir levels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to re-dose </span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he attempted to implement this he was met with huge resistance and was actually threatened to be fired by one of the attendings </span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="4" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This response does not surprise Bob</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rethinking the approach to cancer: using first principles and applying mathematical models [12:15]</span></h2>
<p><b>What drew Bob to radiology, then radiation oncology?</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He liked the intellectual exercise, the puzzle of it</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was a very shy, retiring kid; dealing with patients was very difficult; it was a lot easier to work with films</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was really one of the few things about school that he liked</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>When did he start thinking about cancer differently?</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">His first job was at the </span><a href="https://www.foxchase.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia</span></a>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">His desire to help people was especially strong here because the disease is so awful</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He spent lots of time learning about cancer, reading textbooks, reading the journal </span><a href="https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancer Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the flagship journal of the </span><a href="https://www.aacr.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AACR</span></a>
<ul>
<li aria-level="3" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He asked himself how different studies on cancer fit together</span></li>
<li aria-level="3" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He noticed there were no organizing principles; studies were simply making a series of observations and each was quite separate</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the physics world, observations ultimately led to the development of organizing principles, a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first principle</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observations of planetary motion and data observed by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tycho Brahe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kepler </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">developed a kind of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion"><span style="font-weight: 400;">geometric interaction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and ultimately </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newton </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">developed the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first principles </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that could put this all together </span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One can make the case with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Einstein’s </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">work around the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect"><span style="font-weight: 400;">photoelectric effect</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people think Einstein won the </span><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1921/summary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobel prize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relativity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it was actually for the photoelectric effect</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was not the first to observe it but the first to upt it all together</span></li>

He completed his residency in radiology at the University of Pennsylvania where he also served as chief resident. Bob remains an active clinical radiologist specializing in body imaging.  While working at the Fox Chase Cancer Center after residency, Bob perceived that cancer biology and oncology were awash in data but lacked coherent frameworks of understanding to organize this information and integrate new results. Reaching back to his training in engineering and physical sciences, Bob recognized that cancer was a complex dynamic system (similar, for example, to weather) and that understanding the often nonlinear interactions that govern such systems requires mathematical models and computer simulations.  As a result, most of Bob’s subsequent research has focused on exploring mathematical methods to understand the first principles and key parameters that govern cancer biology and treatment.  In 2008, Bob joined the </span><a href="https://moffitt.org/research-science/researchers/robert-gatenby/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moffitt Cancer Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as chair of radiology and convinced the leadership to add a group of mathematicians to the faculty and form the Integrated Mathematical Oncology (IMO) department. Now numbering 8 faculty mathematicians and over 20 post docs and grad students, the IMO  has catalyzed formation of several disease-oriented teams of oncologists, surgeons, pathologists, radiologists, mathematicians, physicists, cancer biologists, imaging scientists and evolutionary biologists.   These multidisciplinary groups are investigating virtually every aspect of cancer biology and therapy. In fact, IMO members are co-PIs of two ongoing clinical trials that use evolutionary dynamics and computational models to guide therapy. There is no other cancer center in the world that has so completely integrated mathematical modeling and computer simulations into basic science and clinical research.</span></p>

Criticism and skepticism can be far more useful than praise and unflinching belief.

There’s an <a href="http://missioncritical.royalwebhosting.net/intro.html">art and science to critical thinking</a> and how to conduct yourself. There’s a <a href="http://missioncritical.royalwebhosting.net/part2/appeal.html">multitude of fallacious appeals</a> we could spell out, but a good rule of thumb is not to attack the person, attack the ideas. Don’t look for the flaws in the person, look for the flaws in the hypothesis. Let’s keep the brawling to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHMi-j7W2gM">movies depicting minor league hockey teams</a> and political “news” shows.

Thank you for adding to the discussion.

He has developed an adaptive therapy approach for treating cancer which has shown promise in improving survival times with less cumulative drug use. In this episode, Bob explains what brought him into medicine, his search for organizing principles from which to understand cancer, and the mathematical modeling of other complex systems that led him to model the dynamics of tumor cell changes in cancer. He discusses his pilot clinical trial treating metastatic prostate cancer, in which he used an evolutionary game theory model to analyze patient-specific tumor dynamics and determine the on\/off cycling of treatment. He describes how altering chemotherapy to maximize the fitness ratio between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells can increase patient survival and explains how treatment of metastatic cancer may be improved using adaptive therapy and strategic sequencing of different chemotherapy drugs.<br><br>We discuss:<br><\/p> Bob&rsquo;s unlikely path to medicine and disappointment with his medical school experience [1:45];<br> Rethinking the approach to cancer: using first principles and applying mathematical models [12:15];<br> Relating predator-prey models to cancer [26:30];<br> Insights into cancer gathered from ecological models of pests and pesticides [32:15];<br> Bob&rsquo;s&nbsp;pilot clinical&nbsp;trial: the advantages of adaptive therapy compared to standard prostate cancer treatment [41:45];<br> New avenues of cancer therapy: utilizing drug-sensitive cancer cells to control drug-resistant cancer cells [48:15];<br> The vulnerability of small populations of cancer cells and the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;with a &ldquo;single strike&rdquo;&nbsp;treatment&nbsp;approach [56:00];<br> Using&nbsp;a sequence of therapies to&nbsp;make&nbsp;cancer cells more susceptible to targeted treatment [1:05:00];<br> How immunotherapy fits into the cancer treatment toolkit [1:15:30];<br> Why cancer spreads, where it metastasizes, and the source-sync trade off [1:20:15];<br> Defining Eco- and Evo-indices and how they can be used to make better clinical decisions [1:29:45];<br> Advantages of early screening for cancer [1:40:15];<br> Bob&rsquo;s goals for follow-ups after the success of his prostate cancer trial [1:42:15];<br> Treatment options for cancer patients who have &ldquo;failed therapy&rdquo; [1:51:15];<br> More.<br><p>Learn more:&nbsp;https:\/\/peterattiamd.com\/<\/p> <p>Show notes page for this episode: <a href=\"https:\/\/peterattiamd.com\/RobertGatenby\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/peterattiamd.com\/RobertGatenby<\/a><\/p> <p>Subscribe to receive exclusive subscriber-only content:&nbsp;https:\/\/peterattiamd.com\/subscribe\/<\/p> <p>Sign up to receive Peter's email newsletter:&nbsp;https:\/\/peterattiamd.com\/newsletter\/<\/p> <p>Connect with Peter on Facebook | Twitter | Instagram.<\/p>","tag_list":"","truncated_show_notes_140":"<p>Robert (Bob) Gatenby is a radiologist who specializes in exploring theoretical and experimental models of evolutionary dynamics in cancer","truncated_show_notes_280":"<p>Robert (Bob) Gatenby is a radiologist who specializes in exploring theoretical and experimental models of evolutionary dynamics in cancer and cancer drug resistance.

The first story is of the growing discontent in Muslim countries, the roots of Islamic radicalism, and how two extremists, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, joined forces to create the global terrorist organization Al-Qaeda. The second story is about how interpersonal and institutional conflicts between the FBI and CIA led to a massive failure in intelligence and resulted in multiple missed opportunities to predict and prevent the attacks on September 11th, 2001.
